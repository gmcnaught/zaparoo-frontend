/*
 *  blt_emitter.h — engine-agnostic host-side blit display-list emitter.
 *
 *  Builds the per-frame command ring + manages the source-surface heap + drives
 *  the submit/done handshake, per docs/blitter-protocol.md. Develops and tests
 *  against the software reference model with NO hardware; the same emitter feeds
 *  the real fabric when the ring/heap buffers point at the DDR regions.
 *
 *  Reusable by any software engine (Solarus first, then gmloader / OpenBOR) —
 *  the engine binding only translates its draw calls into these calls.
 *
 *  Memory model (matches the contract):
 *    - The caller owns the ring buffer and the source heap (in DDR on hardware,
 *      plain malloc in tests). The emitter is a bump-builder over them.
 *    - Source uploads PERSIST across frames (bump-allocated): upload a static
 *      atlas once, keep its handle, re-blit it every frame for free. Call
 *      blt_heap_reset() to reclaim (e.g. on a quest/scene change).
 *    - Only the command list resets per frame (blt_begin_frame).
 *
 *  GPL-3.0.
