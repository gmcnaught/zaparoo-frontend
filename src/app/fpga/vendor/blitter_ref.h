/*
 *  blitter_ref.h — Software reference model for the MiSTer fabric 2D blitter.
 *
 *  This header IS the machine-readable host<->fabric contract for the
 *  command-driven blitter (fpga-hw-blitter task #002). The C reference model
 *  in blitter_ref.c executes a command list with EXACTLY the semantics the RTL
 *  must implement, so:
 *    - the host command emitter (#006) can be developed + unit-tested with no
 *      hardware, and
 *    - RTL output can be diffed bit-exact against this golden model (#003+),
 *      the gmloader-blitter verification pattern.
 *
 *  Pixel model (v1): 320x240 RGB565 framebuffer, matching the existing
 *  native_video_writer double-buffer + openbor_video_reader scanout. The
 *  blitter is a DROP-IN PRODUCER: it composites into a framebuffer exactly as
 *  the ARM's NativeVideoWriter_WriteFrame does today, then bumps the existing
 *  video control word. The scanout reader is unchanged.
 *
 *  Design lineage: command-list-walked-until-END (Saturn VDP1), per-command
 *  rect blit with colorkey skip-write fast path + optional const-alpha blend
 *  (CV1000). See ../docs/blitter-protocol.md and the epic research doc
 *  research-mister-blitters.md.
