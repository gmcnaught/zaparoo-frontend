/*
 *  glyph_cache.h — general text on the fabric: any font, any size, antialiased.
 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS
 *  ---------------
 *  font6x8.h handles the easy case the feasibility study calls the "bitmap-font
 *  freebie" (§4): a fixed-cell face on the CRT path, where every glyph is a
 *  uniform blit out of one atlas. That case does not generalise — it has one
 *  size, one advance width, no antialiasing, and 64 code points.
 *
 *  This is the general case, and it rests on one observation: THE FABRIC DOES
 *  NOT NEED TO RASTERIZE TEXT IN ORDER TO COMPOSITE IT. A glyph outline is
 *  rasterized once, by the A9, at the size it is first seen; from then on every
 *  frame that draws that glyph is a blit of a cached coverage bitmap. Steady
 *  state is what matters for an offload, and in steady state text is pixels
 *  being moved, not pixels being computed.
 *
 *  So "generalise text" is really three problems, and the contract already has
 *  an answer to each:
 *
 *    1. Antialiasing. Coverage goes in the source's ALPHA, exactly like the
 *       antialiased corner masks — BLT_BLEND_PALPHA composites it. Text AA does
 *       not need a rasterizer in the fabric; it needs alpha in the atlas.
 *
 *    2. Colour. The atlas is colour-free: a texel IS a coverage level, and a
 *       BLT_FMT_PAL8 source resolves it through a 16-entry CLUT ramp whose
 *       entries all carry the same RGB565 and ascending A4. One atlas serves
 *       every colour, at 1 byte per texel instead of 2, and the colour is a
 *       palette selection rather than a re-bake.
 *
 *    3. Cost per frame. A sprite-list entry carries its OWN palette word
 *       (blt_wire.h [Task 4b]), so a whole screen of text — mixed colours
 *       included — collapses into ONE BLT_OP_SPRITELIST command instead of one
 *       command per glyph.
 *
 *  Both PAL8+CLUT and SPRITELIST are production, hardware-validated paths (see
 *  the repo README's status table), so none of this needs new fabric.
 *
 *  WHAT STAYS ON THE A9 — and why that is fine
 *  -------------------------------------------
 *  Outline rasterization (FreeType, QRawFont, whatever the app already uses).
 *  The cost is per DISTINCT (code point, pixel size, subpixel phase), paid once
 *  and amortised to zero: a menu screen touches a few hundred distinct glyphs,
 *  after which the cache is warm for the rest of the session. What does NOT
 *  amortise — and therefore what this does not fix — is text whose SIZE
 *  animates continuously: every size is a fresh rasterization, and the
 *  triangle path cannot scale a cached glyph because it samples no alpha
 *  channel. Scale the box, not the type; or accept the re-raster.
 *
 *  GPL-3.0.
