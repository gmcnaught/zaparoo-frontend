/*
 *  corner_atlas.h — bake antialiased rounded-corner coverage into ARGB4444
 *                   source sprites the fabric can blit.
 *
 *  This is the concrete answer to the "AA rounded corners don't map to a
 *  fixed-function blitter" objection in the Zaparoo feasibility study
 *  (docs/qt-offload-feasibility.md §3, §5.2): a rounded rectangle's flat
 *  interior is FILLs, and its four antialiased arcs are ONE baked quarter-disc
 *  coverage mask blitted four times with HFLIP/VFLIP under BLT_BLEND_PALPHA.
 *
 *  The mask is COLOUR-FREE: RGB is white and only the A4 channel carries
 *  coverage, so a single bake serves every themed colour — the draw supplies
 *  the colour through BLT_F_COLORMOD (see uio_565_to_888 in ui_offload.h,
 *  which makes the tinted arc bit-exact with a plain FILL of the same RGB565).
 *
 *  The bake is pure integer supersampling, once per (radius, alpha) pair at
 *  load time; per frame the A9 emits four 32-byte commands and touches no
 *  pixels. GPL-3.0.
