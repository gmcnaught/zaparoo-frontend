/*
 *  ui_offload.h — a menu-front-end draw layer that runs entirely on the fabric.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS IS
 *  ------------
 *  A worked example of the offload argued in docs/qt-offload-feasibility.md:
 *  a software-rendered (Qt Quick Software / QPainter) front-end stops
 *  rasterizing pixels on the Cortex-A9 and instead emits a per-frame blitter
 *  display list that the fabric composites. The transport is unchanged — the
 *  same DDR double-buffer + doorbell the app already presents through; only
 *  the *source* of the frame changes (feasibility doc §1).
 *
 *  It exists because the study's two hardest objections are the interesting
 *  ones, and both are answered here in code rather than in prose:
 *
 *    1. "Antialiased rounded corners (39 sites) can't map to a fixed-function
 *       blitter."  -> uio_rounded_rect(): the flat interior is three FILLs and
 *       each arc is one baked ARGB4444 coverage mask blitted under
 *       BLT_BLEND_PALPHA with HFLIP/VFLIP. The AA moves into the source asset;
 *       the A9 emits 7 commands and touches no pixels. (corner_atlas.h)
 *
 *    2. "Arbitrary-ratio cover scaling (69 sites) is nearest-texel or nothing."
 *       -> uio_image_scaled(): an exact-ratio draw takes the plain BLIT fast
 *       path, and an arbitrary ratio is emitted as a two-triangle
 *       BLT_OP_TRILIST quad, so the *fabric* resamples. That is what makes a
 *       per-frame animated zoom (focus cues, held-focus animation) free on the
 *       A9 — the case where pre-scaling at decode time cannot help because the
 *       ratio changes every frame.
 *
 *  WHAT IT IS NOT
 *  --------------
 *  Not a hardware measurement. The study's recommendation is measure-first,
 *  and nothing here substitutes for that. uio_stats_t counts *emit-side* work:
 *  commands emitted, destination pixels handed to the fabric, and the pixels a
 *  QPainter path would have rasterized instead. Treat it as an accounting of
 *  what moved, not as a frame-time claim.
 *
 *  MODEL LIMITS (the reference model is 320x240 RGB565, blitter_ref.h)
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  The study targets 352x240 first and reaches 480i through a banded
 *  write-through WORK cache (§5.1). The reference model has a fixed 320x240
 *  framebuffer, so that is the geometry used here; nothing in this layer knows
 *  the framebuffer size except through BLT_FB_WIDTH/HEIGHT, and banding is a
 *  fabric-side concern that does not change the display list.
 *
 *  TRILIST is validated in simulation and against the reference model, but is
 *  NOT yet deployed in the production solarus-mister fabric (see the repo
 *  README) — so the scaling path is exercised here against the golden model,
 *  not on hardware.
 *
 *  GPL-3.0.
